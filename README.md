# Python-Examples
# There are code examples from our various projects written in Python. Code is shown to demonstrate the style of writing.
# You can can take a look at the method example in the Python - trip / views.py
# It is API method for integration with 1C (a widely used SAP counterpart in Russia). The code was developed for the company engaged in transfers. Integration with the main base of the company was required. The data (the large list of new transfers) were sent from 1C through the JSON-RPC protocol. Function file implements the processing of the data, processes and returns the result - which trips have been successfully accomplished.
